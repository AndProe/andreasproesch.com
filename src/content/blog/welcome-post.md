Welcome to my newly redesigned website! I've moved from WordPress to a modern static site built with Astro, and I couldn't be happier with the result.

## Why the Change?

After years of managing a WordPress site, I wanted something simpler, faster, and more cost-effective. Astro gives me:

- **Speed** - Static sites load incredibly fast
- **Simplicity** - Content in Markdown, no database to manage
- **Cost savings** - Free hosting on GitHub Pages
- **Full control** - I can customize everything

## What's Here

On this site you'll find:

- **Blog** - Thoughts on technology leadership, engineering, and building products
- **Speaking** - Information about my conference talks and workshops
- **Books** - Recommendations for books that have shaped my thinking
- **About** - More about my background and what I do

## Stay Connected

Feel free to reach out through the [contact page](/contact) or connect with me on social media. I'm always happy to hear from readers and fellow technology enthusiasts.

Thanks for stopping by!
